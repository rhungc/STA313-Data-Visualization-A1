# STA313-Data-Visualization-A1
Toronto, or the "Hollywood North", is known for its prolific movie industry. Many blockbusters such as X-Men and Robocop have been shot in Toronto. In this assignment, we were given a small dataset on "Movies Shot in Toronto", and we were asked to design a visualization for this dataset. 

In the assignment, I also added an extra dataset from https://ca.investing.com/currencies/cad-usd-historical-data that track the historical exchange rate between USD and CAD. I was curious to see whether exchange rate has any obvious effect to numbers of movie production in Toronto!
